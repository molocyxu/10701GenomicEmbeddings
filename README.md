This project explores whether different genomic foundation models can predict how genes respond to transcription factor perturbations. We'll use a CRISPRa dataset where transcription factors were activated in cells and gene expression changes were measured.
We'll test various foundation model embeddings (Enformer, Nucleotide Transformer, and others) as features for predicting gene expression responses. We'll compare different machine learning approaches. Elastic Net regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural networks and additional models as we explore.
Beyond prediction accuracy, we'll analyze the learned model weights by clustering them to see if we can identify patterns that relate to different types of perturbations or biological pathways. This is an exploratory project to see which genomic embeddings and ML approaches work best for this type of prediction task, and whether the model weights reveal interpretable biological insights. We'll adapt the approach based on what we discover along the way.
